The sources issues:
when the research finishes I DO NOT SEE THE SOURCES i must see a list of bullet sources.

how to visualize the sources?
each time the agent uses a source, there must be an icon of link of the source so i can click and see it.

NOW SOURCES ARE NOT WORKING.
REVIEW CAREFULLY HOW THE AGENTS GENERATE THE RESEARCH! and why the links are not present in the end of the research and on the sitations as i requested.

DO NOT FORGET TO: make the commit, and update the readme.md. Review in the readme.md if the files names are still correct in the project (add thjis as a new plan, all this things we are discussing as PLAN4.md) and add to verify the folder structure of the project and if anything in readme is outdated. etc.
